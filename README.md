# Crowdfund
It is a smart contract I created for Crowdfunding.
The user creates a campaign.
Users can make a pledge by transferring their tokens to a campaign.
After the campaign ends, the campaign creator can claim the funds if the total amount pledged is more than the campaign goal.
Otherwise, if the campaign did not reach its goal, users can withdraw their commitments.
